# Forge IDE

A lightweight, native code editor written in Rust, built on [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui).

> **Status:** early scaffold. Expect rough edges.

## Features

- File explorer with lazily-loaded directory tree
- Tabbed editing with unsaved-change indicators
- Syntax highlighting for many languages (via [syntect](https://github.com/trishume/syntect))
- Cursor line/column in the status bar
- Native open/save dialogs (via [rfd](https://github.com/PolyMeilex/rfd))
- Themes: built-in **Blossom** (default) and **Blossom Light**, plus custom TOML themes

## Themes

Switch themes from **View → Theme**. Your choice is remembered between sessions.

Custom themes are TOML files in the themes folder (**View → Theme → Open Themes Folder**):

| OS      | Location                                          |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Linux   | `~/.config/forge-ide/themes/`                     |
| macOS   | `~/Library/Application Support/forge-ide/themes/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\forge-ide\themes\`                     |

A theme only needs a `name`. Anything you leave out comes from the theme named in `extends`
(`"Blossom"` if you don't set one):

```toml
name = "My Theme"
extends = "Blossom Light"

[ui]
accent = "#0f9d8f"

[syntax]
keyword = "#0f9d8f"
```

See [`themes/example.toml`](themes/example.toml) for every key. After editing a file, use
**View → Theme → Reload Themes**. Files that fail to load are reported in the status bar.

## Getting started

Requires a recent stable Rust toolchain (edition 2024).

```sh
cargo run --release              # opens the current directory
cargo run --release -- path/to/project
```

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Action     | Shortcut |
|------------|----------|
| New file   | Ctrl+N   |
| Open file  | Ctrl+O   |
| Save       | Ctrl+S   |
| Close tab  | Ctrl+W   |

(Cmd instead of Ctrl on macOS.)
